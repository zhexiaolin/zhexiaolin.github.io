== Development
jemdoc is developed by [http://stanford.edu/~jacobm/ Jacob Mattingley].
Please [jacobm@stanford.edu contact Jacob] with any bug reports and
comments.
If reporting a bug, please run the command +jemdoc -\-version+ and include the
result in your email.

There are two levels of support:
- Basic jemdoc, which I will attempt to support well, and
- LaTeX equations in jemdoc, which I may attempt to support.
